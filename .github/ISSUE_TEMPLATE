What version of EnvPane are you using. Did you download the official release or
did you build it yourself?

What version of OS X are you using (or attempting to use) EnvPane on?

Did you install EnvPane for the current user only or for all users? I admit,
that's a bit of a trick question.

Did you install EnvPane as an administrative user?

Can you provide relevant system.log messages? You can use the Console
application to get those: Hit Cmd-Space, type `Console`, hit enter (the Console
app should open), click on `system.log` on the left, click the search bar at
the top and type `Env` to filter the list. Copy and paste it below but be sure
to redact any confidential informations such as account names, IP addresses etc.
